# Snake Game (Pygame)

A simple implementation of the classic **Snake Game** built with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

## Description
You control a snake that moves around the grid. The snake grows when it eats food, and the game ends if it collides with itself (to be implemented).  
Currently, the snake moves in discrete steps across the screen and wraps around when reaching the edges.

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys** → Move Up / Down / Left / Right  
- **W / A / S / D** → Alternative controls for Up / Left / Down / Right  

The snake cannot reverse direction directly (for example, it cannot go from left to right immediately).

## Requirements
- **Python 3.13.5**  
- **pygame 2.6.1**
